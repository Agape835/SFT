WRITE ABOUT ELON MUSK

While no one was looking, Elon Musk created SpaceX, a private company aimed at revolutionizing space travel, ultimately becoming the Pioneer of Commercial Space Travel. And today, SpaceX is one of the world’s most influential entities in aerospace and satellite technologies. I have been fascinated by Elon Musk’s story for years, but recently I decided to go fully down the rabbit hole and learn everything I possibly could on his origin story and path to success.
I probably spent 50+ hours watching interviews, reading news articles, and listening to podcasts, taking notes and trying to piece their path together in a coherent way. Finally, I distilled his remarkable story down into a short essay for you to enjoy.

QUICK BACKSTORY:
Elon Musk grew up in Pretoria, South Africa. His parents divorced when he was just a boy, a challenging obstacle in his early life. A weird fact is that Elon taught himself computer programming at the age of 10 and by 12, he had sold the code of a video game he created.

THE ODDS:
To say Elon Musk was setup for success from the beginning would be an overstatement. The odds of success for the average aerospace start-up are incredibly low, at less than 1%. And only 0.1% makes it to launch a rocket into space.

THE GOAL:
But Elon Musk had his sights set on making space travel accessible and colonizing Mars.And for years, he was relentless about learning, innovating, and persevering.

THE OBSTACLE:
Unfortunately, success turned out to be a lot harder than he originally imagined.Recommended by LinkedIn Ever Wonder How a Rocket Company Changed the Space Shripal Gandhi 1 month ago
How to achieve your life mission the Elon Musk way Roger Hamilton 5 years ago. How SpaceX Reached Orbit, Turning Aerospace on Its Head Idit Aloni 8 years ago.The high cost of rockets and the technical challenges of space travel were major obstacles.Skepticism from the traditional aerospace industry and the public also tested his resolve.And by 2008, after three failed launches, he almost chose to give up.

THE BREAKTHROUGH:
Until one day, the fourth launch of SpaceX's Falcon 1 reached orbit successfully. As the story goes, it was SpaceX's last chance to survive. Had it failed, the company would have gone bankrupt..And the rest is history.

THE ACHIEVEMENT:
Between 2008 and 2023, Elon Musk went on to: Launch the first privately-funded spacecraft (Dragon) to dock with the International Space Station. Develop and launch the Falcon Heavy, the most powerful operational rocket in the world.
Complete multiple resupply missions to the ISS, providing invaluable service to global space infrastructure. Maybe most importantly, he revolutionized the space industry, pushing forward the vision of colonizing Mars.

THE LESSON:
I love Elon Musk’s story because it represents the power of relentless determination in the face of adversity. It reminds us of the power of learning, innovating, and persevering, compounded over time.
Because when we focus on the right things, where we’re headed is certain.We just need the future to catch up.

TASK 4:
1. Identify a Real-Life Situation
Question: Describe a recent situation where you had to make a decision, resolve a conflict, or interact with others. Include the context and key people involved.

Answer: "During a meeting at work, we were discussing the direction of a new project. One of my colleagues, Emma, insisted on following her approach, while the rest of the team had different ideas. I felt that her perspective was valid, but she wasn’t considering other potential strategies. This led to tension in the group as no one wanted to disagree directly with her."

2. Observe and Reflect on Perception
Question: What did you observe during this situation? How did you perceive the actions, emotions, and behaviours of the people involved?

Answer: "I observed that Emma was very confident and assertive, presenting her plan with enthusiasm. However, her tone became defensive when others began to raise questions. The rest of the team seemed hesitant to challenge her ideas, with some avoiding eye contact or offering only minimal feedback. I perceived this hesitation as discomfort, possibly due to Emma’s strong stance."

3. Analyze Your Perception
Question: Do you think your perception was influenced by any biases or past experiences? How could someone else perceive the same situation differently?

Answer: "I realized that my perception might have been influenced by a previous experience where I had dealt with a similarly assertive person who dismissed other ideas. Because of that, I may have assumed Emma wasn’t open to feedback when she might have just been passionate about her approach. Another team member could have perceived her assertiveness as leadership rather than dominance."

4. Connect to Your Values
Question: What values are important to you in this context? How do they influence your interpretation and response to the situation?

Answer: "I value open-mindedness and collaboration. In this context, it’s important to me that everyone feels comfortable sharing their ideas and that all perspectives are considered. I also value respect, which means handling disagreements constructively without making anyone feel marginalized."

5. Take Action Based on Perception and Values
Question: Based on your perception and values, what actions can you take to improve the situation? How will these actions align with your values?

Answer: "I decided to speak up in a calm and respectful manner, suggesting that while Emma’s idea had merit, we could also explore alternative strategies. I emphasized that combining the best elements from different approaches could lead to a more comprehensive plan. This aligned with my values of collaboration and respect, as it allowed space for diverse input without dismissing anyone's ideas."

6. Reflect on the Outcome
Question: What was the result of your actions? Did the outcome reflect your values? What did you learn from the experience?

Answer: "After I spoke up, the team became more open to discussing different ideas. Emma seemed more receptive once she realized that her ideas weren’t being dismissed, and others started sharing their perspectives. The project plan became more collaborative, and the tension eased. I learned that addressing issues respectfully and aligning actions with my values of collaboration and open-mindedness can lead to a more inclusive and effective team dynamic."
